('Theology and Counselling Psychology', '', "Sam Harris, one of the main pillars of new atheism, has said that the success of science often comes at the expense of religious dogma or theology and vice versa. The quote above appears to be a manifestation of the essence of the age of enlightenment, an age which held the supremacy or rational ability and human autonomy. With the advancements in technology and science, people tend to regard theology as obsolete, narrow-minded and only useful when discussing spirituality. This dualistic point of view assumes that theology and science should be well separated. Why? Because science delves into the natural while theology explores the supernatural. As a result of this way of thinking, many people deny the impact of religion and theology on the various the fields of science, an example among these is the area of psychological counselling. To many secular counsellors, psychology-that which is based on ratio and scientific evidence- seems to be the only acceptable basis in the practice of counselling. Meanwhile, christian counsellors do believe that there is some benefit in knowing the science of psychology, and the harmonisation of psychological science and theology can be used to provide peace to clients. So how must theology, psychology and medical science relate to each other in counselling? Is there a place for theology in the realm of counselling? Or is it simply not needed? This piece will examine two prevalent views of this, secular counselling and biblical counselling.\n\n# Secular Counselling\n\nThe first view we will look at is secular counselling, with an approach based on a belief of atheism, rational supremacy and empiricism. There are of course many branches of secular counselling, each with a different emphasis. But in its core, secular counselling rejects the view that God had created man and in addition the authority of the Scriptures in all aspects of human life, including counselling. Their philosophy revolves around man’s ability to change for the better without grace from God, enough simply by relying on the strength and capability of oneself. The many figures that have developed this field include those such as Carl Jung, Carl Rogers, B.F. Skinners among many others, we will discuss briefly two of them which have established a basis for which either modern psychology or counselling rests upon, which are Wilhelm Wundt and Sigmund Freud.\n\n## Wilhelm Wundt\n\nIn the eighteenth century, a psychologist of German descent, Wilhelm Wundt pioneered the development of modern psychology after he created the first psychological laboratory. In addition, Wundt also introduced a new concept in psychology which is physiological psychology. To Wundt, all psychological processes coming from humans are always based upon the arrangement and composition of each individual’s biology. This type of thinking is what has become the standard of physiological psychology, that all our thoughts and actions are controlled by the activity of the brain. Brain activity, including the construction or deconstruction neural pathways and the secretion of enzymes, are what have been thought to be the main reason of human behaviour. Heath Lambert (2012) in his book 'The Biblical Counselling Movement after Adams', argues that Wundt's work integrated psychology to be a part of science which further decreased the influence of theology in counselling. Wundt's way of thinking was not uncommon during his time. His perspective's influence over the age include the increase of trials that acknowledge and dismisses crimes on the basis of the criminal's mental illness or brain damage, which could not be blamed upon him/her. The bible clearly introduces the concept of total depravity. This doctrine realises that the crimes of this world are caused by mankind's fall into sin (Genesis 6:5-7; Psalms 51:7; Romans 3:23). Aside from that, sin also corrupts mankind's status as the image of God so that the orientations of their hearts become that which opposes God and all of His commandments. Proverbs 4:23 states how important it is to keep one's heart clean and sacred as it is there from which life flows or manifests, this includes our actions. The same matter is addressed by Christ in the New Testament, that it is not what comes into the mouth that defiles, but rather what comes out of it. From these few passages, it is clear that the problems and evils of humanity come from the nature of humanity itself which has already fallen into sin. Which means that the problem does not lie merely in the human brain but human nature as a whole, which the Bible refers to as the heart.\n\n## Sigmund Freud\n\nAside from Wilhelm Wundt, another influential figure in psychology as well as counselling which would probably be more familiar to the general public is Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis in counselling. Freud (1907) in his work, 'Obsessive Actions and Religious Practices' writes that religion shares many similarities to a type of neurosis that causes individuals to be obsessed with religious rituals, which are done repeatedly. Not only that, Freud also considers God to only be an imaginative concept and that religion becomes a sort of \"leash\" which restrains humans from becoming barbaric.\n\nOne of Freud's most renowned ideas is the concept that the human mind is divided into three parts, the conscious, the pre-conscious and the unconscious. Freud believed that all human activity and experience are influenced by the unconscious, which is shaped in an individual's past, these influences can be either positive or negative. Furthermore, he believed the problems experienced by his clients are a manifestation of unresolved conflicts in the past and are hidden in their unconscious. Because of this, it is the counsellor's duty to probe into the unconscious and reveal that conflict to the client so that the problem can be resolved.\n\nAt a glance, Freud's words do not seem to entirely clash with the Bible. Does the Bible not speak of the significance of good education during childhood and to avoid bad influences? While this is indeed found in the Bible, the Word goes much deeper, exposing that the root of humanity's every problem is in its sinful nature. This sinfulness is what causes man to become more corrupted as he lives. So in reality, even children are not exempt from the ill effects of sin's existence. One's childhood is not a blank piece of paper, it is not good or even neutral in its nature. It is not a clean slate that is then only tainted by bad influences or bad experiences which will affect that person's future. It is no surprise then, that many studying psychoanalysis or the public in general tend to focus more on the education and wellbeing of children instead of addressing their sinful nature. Children are protected in such a way that they live a sort of \"heaven on earth\", while none focus their efforts to expose them to the Word of God and a Christian worldview as early as possible.\n\nIn summary, where psychoanalysis uses various techniques to encourage human autonomy so that patients are able to control themselves (through their past experiences, from the past and for the future), the Bible actually reveals to us that humanity must depend on God because He is the ruler of human life. When people depend on God, they can again see hope for their lives that are haunted by damage done in the past. Christian faith believes in the complete restorative power of Christ's blood. Isaiah 43:18-19 speaks of how God will redeem and restore the Israelites, even though they are full of evil and sin.\n\n# Biblical Counselling\n\nThe second view that we will look at is Biblical Counselling, which is an antithesis to secular counselling. Biblical counselling aims to build a system and approach in counselling based on Christian values. The Biblical Counselling movement was started by Jay E. Adams, a Christian counsellor believing in reformed theology who longs for the field of counselling to be submitted under Biblical authority. There are a few presuppositions that serve as a basis for the approach of Biblical Counselling.\n\nThe first presupposition is that God created man as a creature whose existence is dependent on God (Acts 17:28; Revelations 4:11). As mankind's creator, it is natural that God has complete knowledge of all human life, including their mental wellbeing. Therefore, it is not possible for man to become autonomous and to find solutions for all the problems they face outside of God, the creator. Cornelius Van Til, a reformed theologian and apologist has devised this concept in what he calls the Creator-Creature distinction. Van Til said that God being the creator would not be a part of creation, there is a qualitative difference between God and His creation, which include humans (Isaiah 40:12-31). On the other hand, man as a creation means that he must totally lean and depend on God in all aspects of his life. Aside from that, God as the creator means that He is the source of all things for all things are made through Him. Through this basis, then all types of knowledge come from God and without God's revelation, it is not possible for man to attain knowledge. Not only that, but all the meaning and purpose of human life, even its existence comes from God. So only God has authority to value the lives of each human (Romans 11:36).\n\nUnderstanding of the Creator-Creature distinction has large implications in the field of counselling. When we realise that all things come from God, including the knowledge of man, then the only way for us to give a form of counselling that glorifies God is to seek His wisdom in His Word. That is how important for Christian counsellors to study and understand the Word and to also live in it. For without understanding and knowing the Bible, how can we attain true wisdom? Yet, it must be noted that Biblical Counselling does not deny the existence of common grace, that God Himself has granted upon man some knowledge, both for believers and non-believers alike. Heath Lambert (2012) explains that Christian counsellors do not reject information gained from outside the Bible such as from science, but that we can use it in everyday practice. But it must be noted that all of such information must be interpreted and understood in the light of the Word of God. Jay Adams (1979) in his book 'A Theology of Christian Counselling' says that, “God does, of course, restrain sin, allow people to discover facts about His creation, etc., in common grace, but God never set up rival systems competitive to the Bible” (p. 8). As an example, one of the major principles of counselling is feeling empathy towards the client. The concept of empathy was developed by Carl Rogers using the client-centred approach that prioritised human autonomy. We are asked to empathise with other people to understand and feel how they feel so we can help them to overcome their problems correctly. This way of thinking assumes that humans have the ability to understand each other correctly and completely, while also assuming that humans are able to help each other. The Bible teaches us firstly, that our help comes from God alone, who created heaven and earth. Our lives are held by the sovereign care of His hand to this day, meaning that He is the one that made our lives what they are today. So, only from Him do we seek our motives, methods and goals of our lives, so that we know why we live, and why did God lead us where we are today and how through our consequences we can glorify His name (Romans 11:36). Secondly, empathy towards fellow men and women are a part of our nature that has been redeemed as one body of Christ. Empathy becomes a sign of being the body of Christ, as a hand will reflexively help a wounded part of the body, and even pain is shared across the whole body. This is the life of a Christian who sees that He has already been redeemed by Christ and has become a part of His body. So empathy becomes a statement of love towards a fellow body part in Christ that expresses and has witnessed how God's love has worked in us. Not only towards other parts of the body of Christ, but also to other humans. In the same way, manifestation of Christ's love is realised through the witness of His body to bring the world to see the love of the Creator to His creation. This is the sign of love for us, God's children (1 John 4:7-8).\n\nThe second presupposition concerns the centrality and authority of the Bible in the practice of counselling. 2 Timothy 3:16 states that the Word of God is profitable for teaching, for reproof and to bring change in one's actions. Paul also states also in a similar fashion in Colossians 1:28. In these verses, Paul is teaching that the Word of God has authority and power to bring out true change in all man. Heath Lambert (2012) wrote an interesting point about the centrality and authority of Scripture in counselling. He states that the Bible is a promise from God that He will give His wisdom when counselling through the Word of God. So, through the Bible we can find numerous principles of truth that can lead and bring people in trouble towards a resolve for their problems. But unfortunately, many Christians believe that the Bible is only useful in matters of life after death and how one will get to heaven. This false and reduced understanding has already been objected by the Second Helvetic Confession as well as the Westminster Confession of Faith which states that the Word of God speaks of a good, healthy and pious life. The Bible is the word of God that will always bring care and assurance to humanity for them to live better in His presence.\n\nWhile it has been said to be so, many still question whether the Bible really provide detailed answers on every topic in the field of counselling. John Frame (2010) in his book, 'The Doctrine of the Word of God' stated that the Bible is not a guide book providing step-by-step information, rather it is a book containing God's revelation to mankind so they can glorify Him in every field. This principle can also be applied to the area of counselling. The Bible does not contain every type of information on every medical and/or mental problems as well as the medications required. Yet, the Bible does explain the principles of counselling needed for a counsellor that glorifies God, for example principles about the source of true change in human life, the root of the problem and its solution, man's identity, and so on. Answers for these topics have been sought out by secular theories for hundreds of years without realising that the Bible has already given the answer far before. Furthermore, the fact that humans have fallen into sin states the importance of God's Word in everyday lives. Sin has entered and corrupted all that God has created. Sin has affected every aspect of human life, from motivations, emotions, the mind, the body and in our relations with other people. The only way for mankind to rid itself from the bondage of sin and to experience true change is when Christ's blood has cleansed everyone who believes in Jesus Christ. The only true release for humanity from its sin is from the redemption of Christ accounted in the Bible. From this basis, counselling's efforts to bring positive change which is both healthy and thorough becomes impossible when not dine with the Word of God that leads to Christ. For from Him only can true change be given!\n\nThis brief piece on secular counselling and biblical counselling are to encourage each reader to together learn to know His truth which He has given to His people to live a life that glorifies Him according to His will. And with so, we are submitting every field of our lives to the supremacy of the Holy Word as a basis, as glasses from which we see the world, and as a true guide.", 1, 3, NOW(), NOW());

('The Ten Commandments', '', 'In this new semester, we will be discussing about the Ten Commandments.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Ten Commandments, the background context of it can be found starting from Genesis 37 up till Exodus 20. In short, Jacob had 12 sons, of whom Joseph was his favourite. Out of envy, 10 of Joseph’s older brothers sold him to the slave traders, and they brought him to Egypt. Joseph was a God-fearing man, and God gave him the gift of interpreting dreams. As he was able to interpret the Pharaoh’s odd dreams and also prophesied, the Pharaoh put him in charge of Egypt. The prophecies that Joseph told saved Egypt from famine. However, even though Egypt was spared from the famine because Joseph has collected and stored all the food produced in the seven years of abundance, the famine was severe everywhere else. This led to Joseph’s family coming to Egypt to buy food. Joseph reunited with his family and his family moved and stayed in Egypt. Eventually Joseph, his brothers, and all that generation died, but the Israelites multiplied greatly and numbered millions. When a new king came to power in Egypt, the Israelites were oppressed. They cried out to God and God sent Moses to bring them out of Egypt.\n\nLet us take a little detour.\n\nMalaysia was once under the control and exploitation of the British Empire, and then taken over by the Portuguese and Japanese for many years, before being conquered again by the United Kingdom. This went on until their founding father Tunku Abdul Rahman stood up to the British, negotiated, and finally gained independence on the 31st of August, in the year 1957. Though Tunku Abdul Rahman was peace-loving and supported equality, democracy failed in Malaysia and corruption resulted.\n\nIn China, as one dynasty followed another, as new emperors emerged after another, the 5000 years of China history was a constant battle between the authority and the oppressed in an unending bloodshed. The March of the Volunteers, the song of Chinese communism, became the National Anthem. It goes like this “起來！不願做奴隸的人們 ! 把我們的血肉，築成我們新的長城 !” which means “Arise! Those who will not be enslaved, Arise! And let us build a new great wall with our very flesh and blood.”\n\nWhat these two snippets of history are trying to emphasize is that people rejoiced when they thought that they have managed to free themselves from being oppressed and escaped, but history told us that they have merely escaped from one form of slavery into another. Men are so willing to fight for freedom and justice with their lives, when in fact all they are doing is escape from one slavery into another.\n\nHowever, in Exodus 20:1-2\n\n> And God spoke all these words: “I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.\n\nGod brought the Israelites out of Egypt, out of slavery, and men are created to be worshippers – to serve something or someone. But what many people are unable to realize is that when they serve God, they are in fact freed from the bondage of this world. It is only when we choose not to worship and serve the true God, our worship of other beings or things will inevitably lead to a torturous slavery.', 1, '2016-07-26 00:00:00', 4, 4, 2, NOW(), NOW()),
('I Am the LORD Thy God', '', "The 10 commandments are an extension to the two greatest commandments found in Luke 10:27\n\n> “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’; and, ‘Love your neighbour as yourself.’”\n\nThe first half of the 10 commandments talks about our relationship with God, and the second half talks about our relationship with humans. These ten commandments are not a means to attain salvation but to live a life pleasing to God.\n\nThis post will discuss about the very first commandment, which is found in Exodus 20:3, ‘You shall have no other gods before me.’ We will first discuss the technical aspect of the verse and then delve into the content of the commandment itself. In verse 2, “I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.” Have you ever thought of why the name of the Lord here is entirely capitalised – LORD? In Hebrew, it would be pronounced Yahweh or YHWH, which is the covenant or personal name of God. When God gave these commandments to the Israelites, the name LORD is used to convey a personal intimacy between God and the Israelites.\n\nVerse 2 also tells us how grace precedes obedience. The Haydelberg Catechism is the most influential historical confession of the reformed faith. It consists of 129 Q & A, which are structured into 3 parts: I) Misery, II) Deliverance, and III) Gratitude. It might come as a surprise initially, but the Ten Commandments fall under Gratitude. Why? Humankind has fallen into sin and God has redeemed us first, before then giving us the Ten Commandments. Thus, grace precedes obedience and we obey the Ten Commandments to express our gratitude for His grace.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible, it is written, “Thou shall have no other gods before me”. What differentiates thou and you? Thou is a singular pronoun whereas you is plural. It means that the Ten Commandments apply to each and everyone of us and the author wanted to imply it is as if God is talking to each of us face to face.\n\nWhat does the content of the commandment itself tell us?\n\n  1. To have God as our God.\n     What does this statement mean? It means to:\n     1. Acknowledge Him as our God. Not just any God, but the God who is revealed in the Bible. We should know Him through submission to the Bible, which is the ultimate authority, and we should not form any other god which is in contrary to the Bible.\n     2. Give Him adoration. Reverence and worship Him. If you were to pay attention closely, the first 4 commandments talk about worship – 1st talks about the object of our worship, 2nd our manner of worship, 3rd the language of our worship, and 4th the time of worship.\n     3. Fear Him.\n     4. Trust fully in Him. Other beings and other things apart from God are finite, infallible, and prone to misdeeds and failure. God is the only one we can build our entire trust upon; He is our rock, He never changes and He is always faithful. When we do not put our trust in Him, we make Him an idol, which is equivalent to a statue, having qualities such as man-made, mute, and useless.\n     5. Love Him. We are to give Him our exclusive and radical love. Love is not a mere feeling; it is also something that we choose to do. It is our duty to choose God and love Him.\n     6. Obey Him. It is only fair to obey the One from whom we receive our beings. God created us and He owns us. But not only does He own us, He also blesses us. He does not intend to dictate us through His commandments, but to show us His love through them. Therefore, our obedience towards God of His commandments flows from a heart that knows of His goodness and is an expression of gratitude, not as a means to earn our salvation.\n  2. To have no other gods. What does this statement mean?\n     1. He is the only God and there is no other (Deuteronomy 4:39).\n     2. To shun all forms of idolatry, of which idolatry refers to placing something above or in equal terms with God. Little do we realize, subtle forms of idolatry involve combining the false one with the true one. There are several examples in the Bible: God told Abraham to leave his idols when He picked him. One of the biggest struggles that Israelites faced is polytheism, which is worshipping other gods together with the YHWH God. In Matthew 6:24, God makes it clear to us that we cannot serve two masters. God does not want a religion that “fits” our lives. He demands the throne in our hearts, the thing that we hold onto and treasure the most. Why? Because our God is a jealous God. Our relationsip with God is likened to that of a marriage covenant where the Christian is the bride and Christ is the bridgegroom. Our God is not only omnipresent, meaning He is present everywhere we are, but He is also omniscient, meaning all-knowing. He knows the content of our hearts and minds, and He demands to be centre of them.\n\n> Having something else at this throne is like bringing your own mistress in front of your spouse. But also committing idolatry with your mistress in front of your spouse. – John Calvin\n\nWe are made to be worshippers. We are always enslaved by something and serving something. But only worship to God creates a life to the fullest because He has created us for Himself.", 2, '2016-08-02 00:00:00', 5, 5, 2, NOW(), NOW()),
('Thou Shalt Have No Other Gods', '', "Literal meaning – Christians cannot make images of worship. Really?\n\nAre we on the same page as Islam, prohibiting all forms of imagery?\n\nNo.\n\n**Tabernacle & Temple** Exodus 25:18-20 two cherubim of gold in the tabernacle. Exodus 28:33-34 priest’s garments contain images of bells and pomegranates. The walls of temple decorated with carvings of palm trees and flowers. These imagery are used to remind the Israelites of the Garden of Eden before the fall, and for us Hebrews 8:5 it depicts the heaven that we are heading towards.\n\n**Bronze snake** Num. 21:6, Israelites rebelled against God for the food that God provided and God sent fiery serpents as punishment. When people repented, God asked Moses to make a bronze snake and set it on a pole, so people can look to it and will be healed. This is the imagery of Christ.\n\n# So what is prohibited?\n\nIt is stated more clearly in Leviticus 26:1; idols for yourselves to **bow down** to. In 2 Kings 18:4, the bronze snake that was made as a sign of God’s healing and salvation was destroyed by King Hezekiah, a man of God, of which there was no other Kings of Judah like Him. Knowing that people had been worshipping the bronze snake since its creation, he destroyed it.\n\nIdols, even those that **depict the LORD**, are prohibited. In Exodus 32, Moses was absent for too long. Thus, the Israelites asked Aaron to make them “gods”, clearly depicting their sinful idea of polytheism. Aaron gave in, but he made one golden calf and said “these are your gods”, but continued to proclaim “tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD [YHWH]”. Although Aaron had the idea of bringing them back to YHWH, he had sinned greatly.\n\nIf the first commandment is to prohibit the worship of other gods in any form, then the second commandment is to prohibit the worship of the one true God according to how we want him to be.\n\n# Why no Idols?\n\n1. God chose to reveal Himself **invisibly**. God had spoken to His people, revealing Himself through His word. But it doesn’t mean that God can’t be revealed visually in a perfect manner to be worthy of worship. In fact, in John 1 , it is written that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and that is Christ. The Christ that we can see, touch, hear, the perfect Image of God was given, so that we do not reduce God to our own imagination.\n\n2. Respect for God’s **true image**. Respect Jesus Christ as the only perfect image that we can bow down to. For He is not just the perfect image of God, He IS God Himself. We are very much reducing God’s glory if we depict Him the way we want; like a carpenter who makes a wooden chair and have the chair sit on him. It is also a respect for the dignity of man as created in the image and likeness of God, that apart from God Himself, only we are like Him. And other creations are put under our dominion. How low have we fallen to revere rocks and woods that are mere creations but despise beggars and widows who are images of God. How much lower have we fallen to revere Pontius Pilate but despise Jesus Christ, the perfect image of God.\n\n3. God as the living God. 1 Cor 12:2 He is not mute like the rock statues. He is living, and not just a powerful force, He is **personal**. If He is as dead as the idol you worship, how can He judge all men? How can He even love you and I?\n\n4. God’s covenant jealousy. He has lowered Himself to make a covenant with us, He, as the unparalleled God, has chosen to be bound by a promise. And He willingly does so EVEN when we break the promise over and over again. And yet we chose to ignore His love and openly declare that it is not He who saved us, but this thing that I have made and put in my house.\n\n# Intergenerational punishment\n\nWhen God said that He will punish those who worship idols to the third and fourth generation, does it mean that God condemns the innocent family members that come? No. Ezekiel 18, son whose father is unfaithful to God, he will be saved if he turns back to God. Deut 24:16, everyone is to be put to death by their **OWN** sins.\n\nWe often want benefits, rights, and blessings, but we don’t want responsibility. When we are irresponsible, we ask God to make it right for us, like He is our maidservant. We have responsibility for our children and our family. When we serve our idols, our children are watching and learning from us. Every day you make a personal demonstration to teach them how to sin against your Creator, and when they turn away from God, how could you dare say that it is because of God’s punishment and not because of your own irresponsibility?\n\nThe effect of sin can go as deep as 4 generations, which is a natural course of action. But to have faith that lasts for thousands of generations, that cannot be possible with our might alone. This is a promise of God that He will sustain. It doesn’t mean that godly fathers will not have ungodly children, but it is a proclamation of God that there will be people in every age and every generation to worship Him, and the true faith is passed down generations to generations unceasingly.\n\n# Contemporary issues\n\n1. **Who we worship**: “My God will never send anyone to hell”. Making your own God who shares the same name as the true God.\n2. **How we worship**: “I live my whole life for God. If I don’t go to church, I will still worship Him when I stay at home. I study hard and do my best to glorify Him.” Half misleading truths that look true on the outside are still sins, like Aaron’s calf.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWhat does your tabernacle look like? It tells you who the God you worship is. By knowing the creator, you know how you ought to live. By knowing why you are created, you know the purpose of your life. Why do you still worship the idol in your heart? Turn back to God, and find out who He truly is.\n\nHow can we do that? Only by the Word of God, can we know who He truly is, and never lie to yourself by thinking that you have known enough of Him, or known much of Him. Only by the word of God, can we know how to worship Him, not just in singing, but with our whole lives. Do not ever lie and tell yourself that you have lived your whole life for God. Pray hard that you will find where your sins lie, and pray that God will lead you to a life that glorifies Him.", 1, '2016-08-09 00:00:00', 4, 4, 2, NOW(), NOW()),
('Thou Shalt Not Take the Lord\'s Name in Vain', '', "“You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.” Exodus 20:7\n\nWhat is the first thing that comes to your mind, is it the prohibition of the use of the slang *Oh my God*? People often think the third commandment simply means to take God’s name with respect. It is not wrong, but truly the commandment means more than just that.\n\nThe first thing to take note is the use of the word “take” rather than “speak”. One of the popular misconception is that this commandment is limited to speech only, but in the original Hebrew text, the word “nasa” was used here. “Nasa” means to lift up, to bear, to carry.\n\nBut other than God Himself, He had caused His name to dwell on other things. God has caused His name to dwell in His temple. The angel who is sent to guide Israel bears the name of the Lord too. But for us Christians, God’s name is on us in a personal way. This is shown clearly in Numbers 6:27, Deuteronomy 28:10, and Revelation 13:6. God places His name on His people, The Great God associates His name to His people. But scripture goes even further to suggest a deeper connection, Psalm 24:3-4. “You shall not take your soul in vain,” Again the word “nasa” is used here. The very same sentence, one for the name of God, one is for our soul. For us to lift up our souls for vanities, to live our lives in vain, and is to take the name of the Lord in vain.\n\nThe King of the universe loves us so much that He had placed His name on us. But it is then also when we live our lives in vain, we bring shame to His name. Since we bear the name, we bear the responsibilities too.\n\nLet us shift our focus the “the name of the LORD”. To name someone is to exercise sovereignty and control over another person. For example parents to children, and a conqueror to a city. But God names Himself, because there is no higher control above Him.\n\nAnd names have meanings. What’s God’s personal name? YHWH. It declares who He is. Exodus 3:14, it means “I AM”. It shows that God is eternal, because it is mentioned the present tense. He has always been, existing in all times and above time. It shows that He is absolute, and he is self-sufficient. Ultimately, He is the LORD.\n\nHe did not just share His name to us, He has also allowed us to call to Him by His name. Most cultures discourage children to call their parents by name. In military forces, we do not call our superiors by name, but by ranks.\n\nBut this Ultimate King has shared His name to us. Such a privilege is given not for us to exercise power over Him, but to call upon Him with love and intimacy. To contemplate on this is to remember how unworthy we are, that we should call Him, let alone by His name. And that His name is imprinted on us, that we may bear His name to be His people. Hallelujah! Praise be to God, for He the High King of heaven is loving and kind.", 2, '2016-08-09 00:00:00', 5, 5, 2, NOW(), NOW()),
('God’s Sovereignty', '', "We know that God is sovereign above all things in Heaven and on earth. We can see throughout many instances in the Bible how His will overarch many aspects of this world. For instance we can observe God’s will in creation and preservation (Ps. 135:6), the government (Daniel 4:35), the life of Christ (Luke 22:42), sanctiﬁcation (Phil. 2:18), election and reprobation (Rom. 9:15-16), regeneration (Jas. 1:18), man’s life and destiny (Acts 18:21), the sufferings of believers (1 Pet. 2:17) and even the littlest things in life (Matt. 10:29).\n\nAccording to the reformed theology, there are four types of the will of God. There are the decretive will of God, preceptive will of God, secret will of God and the revealed will of God. Decretive will of God is the will of God in which whatever He says will deﬁnitely happen, an example of this is the creation of light, when He spoke, ‘*Let there be light*’, light will come into existence. The secret will of God is the will of God that we are not being revealed to. According to Deuteronomy 29:29, there are things that God has chosen not to reveal to us and these secrets belong only to God. As Christians it is not good to pry into these secret will of God as God has made it clear that there are some things that we ought not to know.\n\nAs we have brieﬂy touched on the two aforementioned wills of God, we will focus more on the preceptive will of God and the revealed will of God. The preceptive will of God is usually reﬂected on the laws that He gives, for example is the ten commandments. The ten commandments are God’s will for humans, however He gives us freedom to obey or disobey His preceptive will.\n\nRevealed will of God are the things that God has revealed through the Holy Scripture (Matt. 7:21). The revealed will of God exists so that true children of God may know His preceptive will and understand God more. Going back to Deuteronomy 29:29, we often are more interested in the secret will of God, however we are also reminded to always put our interest on things that have been revealed to us and faithfully obey these things instead.\n\nThis brings us to another discussion on God’s omnipotence (Deut. 7:21). Can God do everything? No. We must remember that God can do everything as long as it does not contradict with His attributes. Furthermore, His attribute of holiness is the attribute that envelopes His whole being. For example, God cannot sin because that will contradict with His holiness.\n\nIn Job 1:12, we can see that for the devil to inﬂict sufferings on Job, he had to ask for permission from God. Whatever things that the devil do are under the sovereign will of God. This can also be observed in the book of Revelation.\n\nWhen humans want to execute something, sometimes we have the will but not the ability, or we do have the ability but no the will. There is almost always a gap between our will and our ability. Unlike us, God does not have this gap, in which whatever that He wills, He has the ability to execute. Therefore how blessed are we to have a God whose will is in accordance to His potency! Romans 8:28 reminds us again how everything really does happen for the good of those who love Him, for whatever things that we go through, are under His sovereignty and power. As we have learned to obey God through His revealed and preceptive will of God, we can have full assurance and hope on this promise of God. The children of God can boldly proclaim that whatever befalls us- be it *pain and suffering*- is under God’s sovereignty and it is always for our good. Thanks be to God who gives us hope through the revealed will of God!", 1, '2016-04-27 00:00:00', 3, 3, 1, NOW(), NOW());
