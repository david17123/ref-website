# General
- Always use American spelling for all things (don't mix it up with any other spelling versions!)

# Database Tables
- Database table and column names always use snake_case.
- Database table names are always plural.
- Always try to use meaningful names for many-to-many relationship tables instead of the default one generated by Laravel.
- By default, tables are to use timestamps (to record created_at and updated_at times) unless special case is considered.
- Boolean columns should always be prefixed with `is_`, e.g. `is_admin`.
- Date columns should always be suffixed with `date_`, e.g. `date_published`. The only exception is the Laravel auto-generated `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamp columns.
- Always use Laravel's migration tool to record migration actions.

# Database Models
- Keep models stupid, i.e. don't put any logic to the models. Leave models as simply database entry representations, including relationships.

# Application logic
- Keep as much of application logic away from controllers as possible. Controllers should only be concerned with handling requests and translating them to be passed on to logic methods (defined in logic classes).
- HTTP errors should never be thrown from logic classes. It is the task of the controller to throw them back to the client.
- Logic classes should throw Exceptions for fatal failures (e.g. user is not authorized), but not for non=fatal failures (no comments found for post).

# Controllers
- Each page typically has their own controller class (named respectively).

# CSS
- Always use BEM and limit nesting to at most 3 levels deep.

# HTML
- Classes and IDs should always use kebab-case (or spinal-case, if you prefer to call it that way).
- Classes that are used for JS manipulations should be prefixed with `js-`. Exceptions would be classes that defines behavior set by CSS, e.g. `hidden`.
